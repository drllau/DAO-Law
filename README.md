# DAO Law
Model laws and other legal organization for DAOs.

## Purpose

Laws drafted to enable better organization on the internet should be technologically neutral and minimize jargon. The goal is to upgrade the system for entity formation and taxation such that DAOs and other internet-native associations can interact with government databases and maintain registration through software alone.

## Definitions

"DAO" means an association identified through public keys on a cryptographic database that can record and execute the association's governance.
